synopsis: An Applicative Functor for extracting parts of a stream of values
description: |
  This provides a way to build up a computation that accesses many different
  indices (possibly out-of-order) of a large stream of values, and run it in a
  single scan over the stream.  In essence, this implements a hash-join.
